# Test Documentation Summary

## Today's Progress (June 16, 2025)
1. **Test Refactoring & Stabilization**:
   - Migrated all major SerpstatApiClient tests (HTTP, cache, integration, rate limiting) to use WireMock and isolated test hosts.
   - Removed real API calls from all unit/integration tests.
   - Fixed and stabilized cache and rate limiting tests (including flakiness and global state issues).
   - Improved test isolation: each test now uses its own client and WireMock instance where needed.
   - Disabled or marked with TODO tests that require production code changes (e.g., timeout configurability).

2. **Code Quality & Standards**:
   - All comments and TODOs are now in English, following project standards.
   - Cleaned up unused imports and improved code readability in test classes.
   - Added clear TODOs for future improvements (timeout, global state, etc).

3. **Test Coverage**:
   - All core SerpstatApiClient features now have stable, repeatable tests.
   - Most previously disabled tests are now active and reliable.
   - Remaining unstable or slow tests are clearly marked for future improvement.

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Refactor production code to allow better testability (e.g., configurable timeouts, non-static rate limiter).
   - Continue converting legacy/disabled tests to modern, isolated style.
   - Target: 100% reliable, fast, and maintainable test suite for all core components.

## Previous Progress (June 15, 2025)
1. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Set up test dependencies (JUnit 5, Mockito, WireMock, AssertJ)
   - Fixed critical NPE bug in SerpstatApiClient.callMethod()

2. **Current Tests (31 active / 81 total)**:
   - `SerpstatApiClientConstructorTest`: 14 tests ✅
   - `SerpstatApiClientBasicTest`: 6 tests ✅
   - `SerpstatApiClientHappyPathTest`: 6 tests ✅
   - `SerpstatApiClientWireMockTest`: 5 tests ✅
   - 50 tests temporarily disabled

3. **Test Coverage Plan**:
   - Phase 1 (Core Components):
     - SerpstatApiClient: 80% complete
     - ToolRegistry: planned
     - BaseToolHandler: planned
     - SerpstatApiResponse: planned
     - RateLimiter: planned

4. **Next Steps**:
   - Convert 50 disabled tests to use WireMock
   - Expected final count: ~100 tests
   - Target coverage: 85% for core components
