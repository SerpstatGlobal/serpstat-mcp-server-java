> **Don't have a Serpstat subscription?** You'll need to purchase one at https://serpstat.com/pricing/

## Step 5: Upgrade Your Claude Subscription

The free Claude plan has very limited usage - you'll need Claude Pro or Teams to generate full SEO reports.

1. **Upgrade Claude**:
    - In Claude Desktop, look for subscription options
    - Choose Claude Pro ($20/month) or Claude Teams
    - This gives you much higher usage limits

## Step 6: Configure Claude Desktop

Now we'll tell Claude how to connect to the Serpstat server.

1. **Open Claude Settings**:
    - In Claude Desktop, click the menu icon (three lines) in the top-right corner
    - Select "Settings"
    - Go to the "Developer" tab
    - Click "Edit Config"

2. **Add the configuration**:
    - Replace everything in the config file with this code:
    - **Remember to replace `PLACE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual Serpstat API token!**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "serpstat": {
      "command": "java",
      "args": [
        "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8",
        "-Dconsole.encoding=UTF-8",
        "-jar",
        "c:/serpstat_mcp/serpstat-mcp-server-java-0.0.2.jar"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SERPSTAT_API_TOKEN": "PLACE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE",
        "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS": "-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Save and restart**:
    - Save the config file
    - Close Claude Desktop completely
    - Open Claude Desktop again

## Step 7: Test the Connection

Let's make sure everything is working properly.

1. **Check for errors**:
    - When Claude starts, look for any error messages
    - If you see errors about Java or the jar file, double-check your file paths

2. **Look for the Serpstat connection**:
    - You should see a small indicator that MCP tools are connected
    - This might appear as a small icon or notification

## Step 8: Create Your First SEO Report!
